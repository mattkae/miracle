miracle-wm (0.2.0-noble) noble; urgency=medium

  - (#35) sway/i3 IPC support has been implemented to minimally support waybar
  - (#45) Added "floating window manager" support whereby individual windows can be made to float above the tiling grid and behave just as they would in a "traditional" floating window manager
  - (#38) The user configuration now automatically reloads when a change is made to it
  - (#37) A terminal option can now be specified in the configuration to decide which terminal is opened up by the keybind. We also do a much better job of deciding on a sane default terminal
  - Environment variables can now be specified in the configuration (e.g. I needed to set mesa_glthread=false to prevent a bunch of screen tearing on my new AMD card)
  - Upgrade to Mir v2.16.4 which brought in a few important bugfixes for miracle-wm
  - (#48) Fullscreened windows are now guaranteed to be on top
  - (#34) Fixed a bug where panels could not be interacted with
  - (#50) Keyboard events are now properly consumed when a workspace switch happens
  - (#61) Outer gaps no longer include inner gaps
  - (#66) Disabled moving fullscreen windows between workspaces
  - (#67) Fixed a bug where resizing a window over and over again would make it progressively tinier due to rounding errors
  - Refactored the tiling window system in a big way for readability. This solved a number of tricky bugs in the process so I am very happy about it
  - (#81) Gaps algorithm no longer leaves some nodes smaller than others
  - The project finally has meaningful tests with many more to come ðŸ§ª
